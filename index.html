            <h2>Key Arguments</h2>
            <h3>For Monitoring and Regulation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Safety and Security:</strong> The internet is a platform for various illegal activities that ranges from hacking,fruad, cyberbullying, and harrassement. Monitoring and regulating the internet is a very good preventive measure aganist them.  </li>
                <li><strong>Protecting Vulnerable Populations:</strong> The internet is a tool to some people that exploit the rich while taking advantage of kids. Scammers purposely mistype words to only target the elderly because they can't read very well and are clueless on scams. Children are also at risk since the internet nowadays since predators can easily find children online. Mointoring and regulation can keep the senile and the young safe.</li>
                <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> The implication of data breaches are huge. The consequence of data breaches last for years. Companies should be monitered so they don't try to withhold that information and cause a sigificantly greater problem.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Against Monitoring and Regulation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Free Speech Concerns:</strong> Risks of infringing on individuals' rights to express themselves. </li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Issues:</strong> Potential invasions of personal privacy. The goal is to monitor the bad and the ugly. It's a gross abuse of power to monitor random people and invade. It would be like if the third amendment was revoked. </li>
                <li><strong>Innovation Stifling:</strong> Over-regulation can hinder new ideas. People will be afarid to make anything when everything is put under scrutiny. A lot of people make content because its their hobby. If people were forced to follow strict regulations, it could deter very creative people from making any content at all. </li>

            <h2>Who Should Regulate?</h2>
            <p>Deciding who should regulate the internet is tough. Each body has their own agenda and goals. But I would perfer it if it was the NSA. National Security Agency. It's a government ggency so they're more likely have strict regulations on themselves on what they can and cannot do. They're also less likely to be hacked themselves since it's an government agency. They aslo already have the power to moniter your phone calls, messages, and emails according to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. </p>
